            "\n",
            "An `IndexError` typically occurs when you attempt to access an index in a list or other sequence that does not exist. This can happen for several reasons:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Out-of-range indexing**: The index you're trying to access is greater than or equal to the length of the list.\n",

            "\n",
            "### Debugging Steps\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Verify the line of code**: Check line 5 of your script to see what operation is being performed. Look for list indexing or slicing operations.\n",
            "2. **Check variable values**: Before the line that's causing the error, print out the values of the variables involved in the indexing operation. This will help you understand what the script is trying to access.\n",
            "3. **List length**: Make sure the list you're trying to index has the expected length. If it's shorter than expected, you'll get an `IndexError`.\n",

            "### Example Code\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's an example of how an `IndexError` can occur:\n",

            "### Corrected Code\n",
            "\n",
            "To fix the `IndexError`, ensure that the index you're trying to access is within the bounds of the list:\n",
            "\n",
